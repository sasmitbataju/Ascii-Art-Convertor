# Ascii Art Convertor
This is my first ever project. I hope you guys can give me feed back on what i can improve. You need to run the script and edit the stuff that are inside. 

Before you do anything, check that you have installed PILLOW already.
(if you have, go ahead and continue)

# Install PILLOW library:
pip install Pillow

# Convert to Grey Scale with: 

.convert("L")

# Save image:
image.save(filename.png)
