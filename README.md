# Ascii Art Convertor
This is my first ever project. I hope you guys can give me feed back on what i can improve. You need to run the script and edit the stuff that are inside. 

Before you do anything, check that you have installed PILLOW already.
(if you have, go ahead and continue)

# Install PILLOW library:
pip install Pillow

# Convert to Grey Scale with: 

.convert("L")

# Save image:
image.save(filename.png)

# Clone this:
https://github.com/RameshAditya/asciify.git

Use this asciify library so you can open the converted file and view it as your very own ascii art.

How to use this is given in there. Read the readme file. I do not own this algorithm. All credit goes to Ramesh Aditya. Go check him out and follow his guide. Enjoy!
